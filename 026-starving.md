# Starving

Clothes were coming off and my stomach growled painfully in my belly.  Alex snickered beneath me but it wasn't long before it was growling again.  

Alex sighed, "You've been asleep for two days.  I think you should..." A yawn interrupted his words and he frowned, "eat.  And I should probably catch some Zs"

"I'm not leaving you."  I said softly.   

"Pretty boy, I haven't really slept in two days.  All you did was sleep and you need to eat.  You can join me after you get something to eat."

I sighed.  "Fine."  I pressed a kiss to Alex's lips and grabbed his t-shirt and pulled it on over my head.  

Alex licked his lips and sighed, "I'd rather have left you naked, but I don't suppose I want all those fucking vampires out there getting a good look at the tasty morsel you are."

I laughed, "They don't care about looks when it comes to food."

Alex nodded, "I don't like Alec, but I know he'll do anything for you.  Like Ant, Vin too.  But the rest, I don't know.  I think you need to let your supernatural council people get you a new neutral place to live."

I nodded.  "I'll see what they have to say when they all join me later."

Alex sat up.  "What?"

"I'm alive.  You know they are all coming to see for themselves."

Alex laid back down.  "In the morning..."  He really was tired.  As soon as he hit the pillow and closed his eyes, he was out.  I felt horrible as I headed out of our room to the kitchen down the hall.  My mind was a mess, full of things we'd talked about, about how much I'd fucked things up by not listening to Alex or Hunter, or even the fucking book full of prophecy.

I hadn't told Alex about the dream.  I turned back and Vin was following me, "You can stay and guard Alex.  Ryan is in the kitchen I hear him.  And Alec can follow me around as necessary.  I need him anyway."

Vin frowned and I made it sound more harsh than I meant to, "Look you can see me all the way to the kitchen.  Alex needs a guard."

Vin nodded and I turned back to walk into the kitchen down the hall.  I could hear Ryan cooking away.  He enjoyed it as much as I did.  But when I got there he was the only one there cooking mountains of food.  "Dude, hungry much?"

He grinned at me in a way only Ryan could.  "It's for you."

"How did you know I was hungry?"

Ryan laughed, "The first time I came back to life the only thing I wanted to do was eat for like three days.  I figured you had to be the same - and then some."

I nodded as if I understood.  But Ryan was Chevalier he did understand so I sat down and let him cook.  "Where's Jin?"

"We've sent word out that everyone should come back to work.  Not why they should, we want to keep your survival under wraps still, right?"

I nodded, "Yeah.  I need all the supernatural leaders to come or send someone they trust.  I need the book, I need Hunter's dream book."

Ryan laughed, "Slow down."

I shook my head.  "I can't.  I fucked up.  I need Doc, and Terry.  If we can get Trix that would be great, but I'd trust Jack or Sage better."

"It sounds like you need a herd of your own?"  Cari said from the hall entrance.

"What I need is a staff, to do all the things I can't."  

Cari smiled and sat down next to me.  "My people will gladly help, they are on their way up, Allison is bringing the book as you requested and will call whoever you need until Jin gets back.  But what do you need a doctor and lawyer for."

"I need financials too, but Alex is doing the money things so I'll wait till he's awake to tackle that issue."

"Why are you so motivated?"

"I died."  I turned to Cari, "I fucking died.  And I came back to life.  Second chances don't come along too often."

"It's not a second chance."  She declared coldly.

"What do you mean?"

"Nox, you are Ascendant."  Cari said.

"And unique from a medical point of view."  Doctor Bryan May added from the hall followed by the other five of Cari's herd - her family - her staff: A doctor, a lawyer, a banker, a hacker and her personal assistant.  

"Tell him in words he'll understand, Cari, he's supernatural but he doesn't want to hear prophecy."

I sighed, "I'll hear it.  I have to.  I not only promised Alex but he was right, I need to know so I can be warned."

Cari smiled, her fangs glinting in her mouth before it faded as quickly as it came.  She was happy I'd said it, but I wasn't so sure.  It was going to be work to not freak the fuck out over it.

"But how do you mean, Doc.  I was going to tell you to do whatever work you needed on me so we could figure this out."

He smiled, "I would like another blood sample."

"When Alec is here.  Alex won't like it but Alec can maintain my sanity."  I said.

Doc nodded, "Your hacker friend, gave Alex information about you from the Venatori databases.  Which Alex gave to me when you were here on your death bed the first time.  I've found some interesting tidbits, none of it makes sense."

Ryan laughed, "It does make sense all of it, you just don't see it yet.  Just tell him already."  Ryan shoved a plate of food in my direction and I started eating.  I wasn't exactly sure what it was, but at this point I didn't care, I was starving and even though the conversation was keeping my attention my stomach hadn't stopped rumbling since I entered the kitchen.
