# Totally Fucked (Alex)

I really was tired.  And I watched Nox walk away thinking it was the last time he'd see me.  Maybe it would have been if things hadn't gone the way they had.  That past few weeks had been a rollercoaster of shit storms.  Vampires and books being the least of my concern.  My pretty boy was still a mess.  Probably even more so now than before.  Or maybe it was just because I saw it all.  He was right about that.  

There were no more reassurances he could give me.  He'd given me his heart, body and soul and the only thing he had left to give was control of his life.  He'd given me a family - something I'd never had before.  

I sat on the floor in the hall of the Night Life building wondering how the fuck I got here.  I was a loner.  My life was my own.  Now a few rooms down there was my very own daughter.  And three small children who I was in love with.  My brother-in-laws were part of the package deal too, but they were more like sons than brothers.  Taking the whole I'm a parent to teenagers to a whole new level.  And that didn't even begin to cover the fucking pack of werewolves now.  A teenage boy pulled more people to Nox than anyone else.  

There were dragons tied to him.  And fucking vampires.  And I was human.  What did I have to give him.  Obviously whatever it was, it wasn't enough.

_Shut the fuck up!_ a voice in my head said.

I looked around and saw no one.  _You are daft.  You are bound to my master and I thought his thoughts were crap._

_Ant?_

_duh!_

_Where are you?_

A door opened a short ways down from ours, "In my room. I can't sleep with your self pity."

"But you can sleep with his?"  I asked getting up and following Ant back into his room so he could go back to bed.

"Nox was always muted, and with that new rune I hear less of him.  But that scares him."  Ant said.

I sat down in an empty chair while Ant crawled back in bed.  "I know.  I can't fix that though, it's embedded in his skin."

Ant chuckled, "I'm sure there is a way to remove it.  Or turn it off. He's just not figured it out yet."

"Maybe.  But that doesn't help now."

"What are you two fighting about now?"  Ant asked.

"What makes you think we are fighting?"

"He's broken into a thousand little pieces.  Tell me you can't feel it."

"He's always broken."

Ant nodded. "Not like this though."

I sighed and leaned back in the chair and stared at the ceiling.  "He feels the depths of what I'm feeling.  He doesn't hear my thoughts, but he's feeling the things I would never tell him."

"That is part of the bond.  There are no secrets between you two.  Not ever again.  If you cheat on him, he'll know.  If he's planning a surprise party, you'll know.  So our deep dark secrets are revealed."

"You're mother and father have no secrets?"

Ant smirked, "My father is married to another woman, has children with another woman.  What secrets are there to hide?"

I shrugged.  "I dunno.  I guess I never thought about it.  Not that I even know your fucking family."

"There are no secrets.  It's why my father can control my mother in a way that no one else can.  He knows what she'll do before she does it.  And she him."

"why would anyone do this? Everyone has secrets."

Ant nodded, "Nox doesn't.  Did you ever think about it.  What is a secret to Nox, is a secret no one has told him.  He's an open book.  You of all people know this."

"So why didn't he tell me how I could live forever?"

"Because you read him."  Ant said aptly.  He was right.  I knew Nox had been thinking of the ways to make me live forever.  There were two ways with in his mind - the first was abhorent - to become a vampire.  I couldn't even begin to consider that.  The second meant killing another person and I knew he'd never go for that.  So my options were limited.

"I don't have to kill anyone to take you Chevalier."

"You know that's creepy right?"  I grinned.

"You do it to Nox all the time."

"Do I?"  I asked.

"All the time."  He said.  "I can take you Chevalier and let you go any time you want.  It's sharing blood and a simple chant on my part to bind you to me." 

"And no one would have to die?  So why did I think someone had to die?"  I asked.

"Because that is the bond most prevalent on Nox's mind.  Ryan is bound to Cari with his life.  We've since transfered his bond to mine and we don't know if it'll take me with Ryan's death or not.  And we don't know if my bond to him is like that, or like Cari and Allison's bond.  Or any of the others.  Freely broken no worries about a life ending." 

"Oh."  I said softly.  

"A Chevalier bond is a vampires human servant.  Their eyes and ears in the day time, their protectors while at their weakest.  Sometimes they are food as in Cari's case.  In mine I need neither.  It would be a bond of convenience and fulfill the triumvirate bonds making Nox even more of a target and more powerful.  Likely enhancing our abilities as well."

"And you tell me this why?"  I asked.

"Because it can correct one of your issues, but will make one worse."

"Which ones?"

"You will remain young forever.  You won't grow old and you won't die of natural causes.  Burning and losing your head are about the only unhealable causes of death to a Chevalier.  But completing the bonds makes Nox the most powerful being on the planet.  You have issues with his 'king' of New York status, but imagine if he ruled all through shear force of power.  Not because he wants it Alex, but because he has the power.  Power is what rules the supernatural.  An Ascendant with the power of a triumvirate is unstoppable."

I sighed, "He who controls the power controls the world.  Got it.  Live with my pretty boy forever and share him with the world.  Or grow old and die and make him wait till I'm reborn again and again until I submit to being his forever.  I don't think I'll keep him waiting."

Ant grinned.  "I don't have to bite your, or you bite me.  You say when and I'll be there.  I may not like you all the time, but Nox fucking loves you."

I laughed, "Sometimes I wonder why."
