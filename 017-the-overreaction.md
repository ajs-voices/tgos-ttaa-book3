# The Overreaction

Hunter started whispering to Alex and I heard my name. "Hunter, babe, I can hear you." He looked at me and frowned. "Go tell Alex in the other room. I know you need to talk about it, it's okay."

"Why does it matter?" Alex asked.

"I told Hunter, I didn't want to hear his dreams about me. Told him if he dreamt about me, or saw things about me he needed to tell you, or Dorian, or my Dad, Rider, Laker, anyone but me. I don't want to know what he sees in **my** future."

Alex nodded. "I guess that makes sense, but you'd think you'd want to know if you'd die or something." Hunter pressed his face into Alex's neck and I knew that's what he'd seen. I dropped my gaze and tried not to think about it. 

"I don't like prophecy or foresight or knowing something's going to happen."

"But you could stop it," Alex almost shouted.

"No, if it's meant to be it'll happen regardless if try to not make it happen. Alex I'm going to die one day. And it's not going to be of old age in our bed as much as I'd love that to be the case. What I do is dangerous. But I don't know how to do anything else."

Alex sighed. "I just don't understand. Agree to disagree?"

I smiled at Alex. "Yeah. Go listen to Hunter's story and help him get through whatever it was he saw."

Alex carried Hunter away and I could tell the little man was crying.

Quinn asked, "What's wrong with him?"

"Hunter sees things no one else can. He glimpses the past - things he's never actually seen before, and he sees the future possibilities. When the water broke all over the floor I think he saw something in it - or remembered a dream. Most of the time he doesn't understand it. And it's all scary," I said.

"And Dad can help him?"

"Any of us can help him. Hunter just needs to tell someone. We've found that helps him. Even with the rune his ability still gets through apparently."

Cass interrupted, "It's better though. He smiles more. He plays more. I missed my Hunter."

"I know you do babe, we'll get things fixed so he's always smiling."

Jin came in with Ricky following and the kids all waved. "Living arrangements suitable?" I asked

"Sure, more than adequate."

"Alex and I will be out late tonight, might spend the night at his place, you can hold down the fort?" I asked.

Ricky looked at the kids and Rider grinned. "We got this Nox. We won't give him too much trouble."

"Don't stay up too late," I told the trouble makers. Ricky was about to be baptized in fire.  "Quinn, you think you'll be okay with the rest of the kids. Jin will show you to your room, and we can do some decorating. I think we are all going to have to move, but for now this is home."

"You aren't going to sent me home?" she asked.

"Why would I send you back to an abusive parent?" I asked.

I said it too loud, and all of the kids looked at Quinn. Rider was there first to wrap his arms around her. "I'll show you to your room. And I'll beat down anyone who touches you. Got it?"

He took her like he had every other kid I'd brought home to my little brother. He winked at me as he led Quinn to the bedroom hall and Cass was right there with him. "I'll come too. I can share some of my pretty things to brighten your room." She leaned in and whispered loudly, "And we can make more."

"Rider, watch Cass and the magic - no fire please."

"Right. I remember what happened last time."

Alex came in with fire in his eyes, he was carrying Hunter still. "You are not going to that meeting tonight."

"I am and you are coming with me."

He shook his head. "No." He set Hunter down and he went to eat his melted ice-cream.  Which was only melted for a little while before he chilled it solid again. They learned quickly. I was proud.

"Nox."

I looked at Alex and he was still fuming. "We are going, Alex. You, me and Ant. I called the meeting."

"Nox you can't go." I headed for our room and grabbed Alex's hand as I walked past him.   He didn't hesitate but he dragged his feet.

"This wasn't about you saving me, Alex. It was about helping Hunter," I said.

"Nox."

"Alex," I interrupted and stopped in front of our door, Vin was standing down at the other end of the hall trying to ignore us. "I'm going. I will not be frightened by a dream."

"But you saw how real they can be." Alex growled. "Look at your back!"

"And look at me Alex. I'm standing here. Stronger, with my family - here. I'm not broken by the beatings I took every night. I'm not broken because I don't let my dreams dictate who I am or who I'll be."

"Even if you die?"

I sighed. "That's why I'll have you and Ant with me. But no one at this meeting is going to hurt me, they are friends."

"Nox, please don't go."

"Alex, I have to. I have to settle this matter. If you don't want to come I understand. But I really want you there with me."

"I can't make you stay home?"

I shook my head. "No."

"Will you take extra fire power with you? Ryan, Cari, Wheoever else will come. And who will we leave here if we take all the fighters? Make it impossible to get in through normal means you can do that can't you?"

I nodded. "Yeah I guess we could."

"Please," Alex begged.

"Okay."  I looked down the hall at Vin. "Can you get Ant to arrange that? I need Cari's help."

"I will send word immediately. It'll be a few hours till dusk."

I nodded. "That's fine. I can set my own wards and protections."

"That okay?" I looked at Alex. 

"No." He growled, "But better."

"We okay?" I asked cautiously.

Alex took my hand and pulled me close. "We're great." Alex pressed a kiss to my lips and I let a moan loose that Alex growled over as he fumbled for the bedroom door.
