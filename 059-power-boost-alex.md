# Power Boost (Alex)

I didn't have to wait long before my eyes adjusted to the dark cell I was in.  But there was no lights.  I was human I didn't have super human eyes like the rest of the family did.  Except I heard them all afraid and alone all around me, but the only thing within physical reach were cold damp walls.

I ran my fingers over the spot I knew my connection to Nox was.  "You better find me pretty boy."  He said to himself.

And with all his might he tried to talk to Nox through their connection.  There was crying down the way.  It was faint and I knew it was going to be one of the kids.  I didn't care if it garnered punishment.  I shouted, "It's alright.  We'll get through this.  With each other."

A strange sound came from the next block over.  And I only knew it was the next block because it was delightfully close.  Almost too close, like we were separated by thin walls - which meant the stronger kids might be able to break through.

But the strange sound came again and this time I recognized it for what it was - Ant waking up from whatever they'd done to him.  I wondered if I'd sounded like that.

"Alex?"

"Yeah.  We're all here.  No one seems to be hurt.  Nox isn't going to feel much except fear."

"So let's make sure he feels something."

"How are we going to do that?"

"Remember what we were talking about before?"  Ant said.

"What are you going to do break down the wall so you can bite me."  I said , my voice was dripping with sarcasm.

"No.  But the walls are thin enough I can reach around.  Hurts like fuck but I can dislocate my arm to do it."  Ant's fingers reached around the corner but only the tips.  "Cut your self, bite I don't give a fuck. I'll do the same and we'll share blood.  First me, then you, and as you are licking it from my fingers I can do the spell.  But we won't have much time.  The tiny amount we share should be enough but I don't know."

"Isn't that how you make vampires too?"

Ant chuckled, it wasn't a funny situation but he found the humor in my freaking out.  Thanks a fucking lot - fucking vampires!  "It's a different spell.  And you don't have to die with my blood in your system."

Only a shallow relief.  "And this theory is that Nox will feel it.  But won't the rest of the world too?"

"Yeah, but it'll give us more power.  You won't be able to do what Nox does, but it should make us better at what we do.  Maybe you can control a guard and unlock the gates, or I can blast a hole out.  Either way we get a power boost too."

"Okay - fine... "

"Seriously?"  Ant asked.

"We need out of here right?  Nox needs to know something is up.  If I'm chewing on my arm and then there is some sudden power boost he'll come look right?  And maybe we'll get out of here before then.  With that power boost you were talking about."

"I'm sorry it's going this way.  It could have been better."

"What you biting me?  All sexy like."  I said with all the seduction I could fake while stuck in the darkness without my pretty boy. 

Ant sighed, "Well it could have gone that way, but no.  It could have been something different built on trust instead of desperation."  He sounded defeated like this wasn't how he wanted it to go down.

"I'm not desperate Ant.  The situation is dire, but I'd made up my mind before I got kidnapped I was doing this.  I just didn't expect to be doing it to save my life, and your's but most of all I'd do anything to save the kids.  But I was already going to do this."

"Are you sure?"

"One hundred and ten percent positive Ant.  Sign me up for immortality.  I want to live with him."

Ant chuckled, "Even after that fight."

I sighed, "Especially because of that fight.  How often does he stand up for himself?  If he can stand up to me, he can stand up to the world."

I didn't bother looking around for something to make myself bleed.  I felt for my wallet and breathed a sigh of relief. Chewing off my arm didn't sound a great prospect.  Inside one of the credit card flaps was an emergency lock pick set.  The card it self wasn't sharp but once the tools were released the edges in some cases were sharp to cut.  I had cut myself accidentally when I first bought one.  I would need to replace it later, but it did the job I needed to do.  Being a vampire would be easier but then I wouldn't be doing this either.  I winced as I drew the sharp edge across my skin deeply.  I was just grateful I wasn't biting myself with my teeth as gory as it sounded I didn't want to see the truth of it.

We shared blood.  I fucking sucked the blood from Ant's fingers and given the fucking innuendo I could have and would have played with if it were any other situation I was still surprised when Ant said nothing even as I was catching the blood dripping from his fingers with my tongue.  

I tried not to think about it as Ant chanted and I tasted the coppery sticky flood still in my mouth.  And as the chant ended something snapped into place.  I felt Ant in a way that I'd never felt someones head.  And through him I felt Nox.  And there was power between the three of us.  

I heard gasping from the cells around us, but Ant was groaning and I was on my knees.  I don't know when it happened, when I collapsed against the iron gates.  I felt sick to my stomach, and there was no warning as I lost the contents of my stomach to the cold hard floor.  I heard Ant in the next block doing the same.  I prayed Nox wasn't fighting for his life at that moment.
