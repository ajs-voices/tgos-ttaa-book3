# Decision to Make (Alex)

I left Ant's room and went to a spare room.  Nox was up and off doing whatever the fuck he did and I didn't really care one way or the other.  Except I did care.  I couldn't help though.  The kids were asleep in our bed. I could stay with them.  But the whole pack thing was not appealing.  I wanted alone time.  I couldn't imagine being around people all the time.  

I got Nox was a touchy feely kid.  He'd been that way in the dreams.  His hand resting on mine.  Or when we were intimate the way his fingers always itched to touch me.  He particularly hated the no touching games - even more so when I told him he couldn't touch me.  I hadn't understood the gravity of it until I'd met him in real life.  

His hands always needing to find me.  And I wished it was only me that could comfort him.  That I was all he needed.  I stared at the new tattoo on my arm.  It moved ever so lightly in and out, darker and lighter and if I touched it I felt him on such a level I knew he was safe.  I knew if he was scared.  I wanted to be his everything but I was clearly lacking.  He needed Ant, and Margo and Ryan.  He needed his family and friends.  He needed the vampires and the wolves.  He needed the wiccans.  He didn't need me.

But he wanted to need me I thought.  I knew the desire, the thoughts the world in his thoughts.  I couldn't be what he needed.  He needed so much.  I could leave.  He gave me room to leave.  That's what he'd meant when he said he'd seem me when he'd see me.  He was giving me permission to leave.  To end the pain we were both going through.  But then what of the promises we'd just made.  The unborn child magic had given us.  

I was going to grow old and die.  He would watch me grow old.  He would stay young and goregous and so fucking Nox.  And I would gray and turn weak.  Unless I sucked a vampire.  Which sounded like some fucking sexual act but Ant had said I wouldn't need to bite him.  Sharing blood.

It really wasn't a hard decision but I had gone from a man who had no one to a man who was bound more ways than I could fucking count in a little more than a month - give or take.  I didn't understand any of it.  I guess it didn't matter if Nox was mine.  He'd never be all mine, but he'd be mine - forever.  And that is what I'd do.  I'd bind my fucking self to a fucking vampire - a vampire I was only mildly sure wasn't into my pretty boy.  But I'd do it.  I'd make the vow bind myself to Ant and make Nox more powerful than he was now.  Because I couldn't leave him.  

There was a scream and then complete silence.  I thought I imagined the scream and I strained to listen - with all my senses.  I heard nothing.  I felt nothing.  Something was wrong.  And then someone burst into the room and I was wrapped in something and then there was nothing but utter darkness.

But I was a dream walker.  So whatever they'd done I could still go get help.  At least I hoped someone who could help was still asleep.  There was a shield around me, around but I was able to slip past it.  It wasn't there, but was but was strange.  The dream was always strange with magic, but I slipped through and there was no alarms set.  No one came after me as I searched.

I found Benji's bubble sleeping simply, but Benji wasn't going to be able to tell Nox.  He might have his number, but Benji couldn't really help if Nox was down in the tunnels.  He needed someone else someone with a better means of talking to him.  The Wicked Truth...

And I was there standing outside his apartment building and there was no Sage Morgan.  No wife either, they were awake.  I wondered if they were early risers too.  Jack, Chevalier, I didn't know and he was likely up too.

I was running out of people who could help.  I didn't know Il Cane, or her mate.  Not that I could find either in the dreams.  I only knew I could find Ant because of his bond to Nox - and soon to me I remembered.  But there had been no one awake with the disturbance out our place.  

There was a fine line running from me to somewhere else.  I ran my fingers over it.  I'd never seen a connection running from myself.  It felt like forests, and savanah and wide open spaces.  It felt natural and nature filled and this must be the pack bond in it's infancy.  Nox's had been strong, and green and leafy and this, was new, a fledgling even the color of new leaves on trees.  And it extend into the world somewhere.  I followed it and found a dream I hadn't expected to find.  A man I wasn't sure I wanted to disturb.  His dreams could be far scarier than Nox's ever were.  But I put my hand on his bubble and I pushed through.
