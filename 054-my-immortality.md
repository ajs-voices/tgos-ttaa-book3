# My Immortality

Alex and I were finally alone - again.  But even with Rider trying to manage the kids before the night was out, everyone was in our bed.  Alex didn't seem so putout but I hated that we didn't get time alone.  And I knew it would grate on him eventually.

I was up before everyone else and Alex soon followed.  Not because he was awake but because he didn't want to be in the bed with that many people alone.  Even though he was pack.  He didn't have the same draw, or maybe he did now and just was denying it.  He'd learn he couldn't do that forever, but he
 was human in a therian world.  He was supernatural.  The demon had called him a name.

Alex said, "Eidolon."

"Why don't you go back to bed you are like walking dead right now."  I said without really a question.  Alex looked tired.

"I'll be fine."  He held up his cup of coffee, "I'll get used to this."

"You realize most adults are up at this hour."  I poked at Alex.

"Not any sane ones."  He griped and then too a slow sip of his coffee.  "What's for breakfast?"

"Pancakes for you, eggs, toast and bacon for everyone else.  But you can have that too."

"So I'm the only one who gets pancakes, why?"

"Because they need to learn that pancakes are everyday things."

Alex nodded, "But they are for me?"

"If you want to eat that many carbs whom I to stop you?"

"The man cooking me food?"  Alex asked.

"Do you not want pancakes?"

"Don't make things special for me."  Alex said.

"But that's my job, Z.  I only want to make you happy."

"Then come back to bed with me."  Alex said just as Jin, Ricky and Ryan came into the room.

I sighed.  "I'm sorry babe, looks like they found me."

Jin looked at Alex a bit confused, "Are we interrupting?"

Alex shook his head, "No.  I was just going to go back to bed."

"Alex..."  I started.

"It's okay pretty boy.  You are right, I'm still dead.  Someone kept me up too late last night."

I smirked, "Would you like me to stop?"

He turned back to me with a look of horror playing on his face.  "No, not ever.  Not even when I'm old and grey."  And as the words came out of his mouth Alex frowned and waved a good bye.  _Stay pretty boy._  He said in my head and left the room.  I couldn't follow after him, the command had been deafening.  I stared after Alex afraid things were going to blow up in our faces over something a simple as getting 'old' together.  Except if the theories were right, I wasn't going to get old.  

Ryan looked the direction Alex left and shoved me out of the kitchen, "Sit down, Nox.  I'll finish up breakfast."

I moved slowly and sat down and hung my head against the palms of my hands.  Ryan busied himself with cooking breakfast.  Jin set down the planner, "We have quite a few meetings today."

I shook my head, "No clear my schedule of everything but lunch.  I have missing people to find and an organization to disrupt their plans."

"Nox, we can't keep putting these things off?"

"What things?" I growled.

"The appointments to your council are coming in.  They want to meet with you.  They need to make sure you understand them."

"Well if they want me to understand them, they need to understand me.  Today I'm traipsing through tunnels looking for the rest of their fucking missing people so if they want to join me they can."  My anger ran its course and I was fuming inside.  The power outside was consistent with normal, and inside I only felt the heat of my own voice.  I was balanced in a way I never thought possible.  I was fucking scared.

Ryan interrupted, "Jin.  Tell them it's a walking meeting.  And if they don't want to help then they can reschedule.  This is important.  As saving the world always is."

"It's not saving the world, just a few people."  I said.

Ryan smiled and put his hand on my shoulder.  "I know.  But that is the world to some.  I'm your's now.  Ant sleeps, I'm with you."

"So you never get to see your best friend again?"

Ryan laughed, "We have several hours of shared awake time.  I saw him off to bed, and he will see me off to bed.  Plenty of time for the three of us to spar and kick your ass."

"Much appreciated." I said.

"You know there is a solution to the problem you and Alex are having."

"Alex would never agree to becoming a vampire."  I said.

Ryan laughed, "Ant is the second, if not most powerful vampire I know.  Cari holds seven bonds at one time because she sires none.  Well except Johnny.  But still, Ant has no childe.  He has me, but my bond is still sorta tied to Cari.  I think that it's stretched between the three of us, most of it to us."

"But if you die, she dies."  I said.

He nodded, "I think so.  But Ant can take another Chevalier.  Even if he brings Isabelle into his claim by either vampire or chevalier.  Alex could live forever."

"It's not my decision to make Ryan."

"But you could suggest it."  He said.

I shook my head.  "I don't think Alex would take the suggestion well from me.  Like he's not enough.  And I will love him forever.  I will break when he's gone.  I don't know if I'd be able to go on."

"You would Nox.  You would because he'd tell you to.  You know that right."

I shook my head, "No.  Alex would be gone long before he felt too old.  We struggle through this because we both believe the other deserves better than what we offer the other."

Ryan laughed, "That's life."  He bent over the counter and removed my hands from my face and I looked up to see his green eyes.  "Go talk to him about it.  I promise you it will be alright."

I stood up and only nodded, I wasn't sure that I wanted to do this, but Ryan was right - we had to talk about it.

Ryan grinned, "Hey Nox.  I spoke with Margo.  She's going to show me all your therapy sessions.  Since you can't come to the AU building any longer, she's giving you over to someone else."

I turned and looked at him, "You?"

He grinned.  "I might look sixteen.  But I have several doctorates in psychology from children to the arcane crap.  I have been bonded to a psychopath for almost all of my life.  I had to find alternative ways of helping myself and help her.  Let me help you."

I growled and nodded, "That's why Ant brought you on?"

"Yes and no.  Ant brought me on cause I asked him to.  For the same reason Ant follows you.  I follow you.  Because you give my life a new meaning.  One that I need to follow.  Ant agreed mostly because he's my best friend and can't say no to me.  And Cari understood.  800 years we've been together, she's a good friend, but I was always her servant.  With you, I won't be.  Let me help you and Hunter, and Alex and just let me help."  It sounded like Ryan was begging.

I nodded.  "Alright.  It might take a while to get you up to speed. With you being a body guard too and all."

Ryan laughed, "that's alright I got you covered in everything bro.  Don't worry.  Go talk to him, Tell him.  Ant has already agreed.  He told me to tell you."

Ant was on board.  I didn't think Alex would be.
