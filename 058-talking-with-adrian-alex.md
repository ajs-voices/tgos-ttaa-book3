# Talking with Adrian (Alex)

The dream was dimmly lit, there was a man standing naked over another partially closed man and I frowned.  It had to be a fucking sex dream.

The naked man turned and I got a good frontal view but it barely registered as he blinked out of existence and the man I'd come to see laughed, "Fantasies are just that Alex.  You come into them and you expect to find what you didn't expect."

Adrian was dressed in a black leather loin cloth and spiked collar hunched over a stool.  He sat up.  "Your interruption must be important."

"It is.  Nox needs to know something happened at the Night Life building.  I don't know what I've been knocked out and everyone else was woken too.  They had someone to wrap me in air so I didn't run or scream."

Adrian dimmed a little and mummbled something and then he turned to me and his clothing changed.  "You are pretty good at this dream thing."

He smiled, "Leah will send a warning with Liam and Liam will find Nox.  And tell him.  But we can talk while we wait."

"You aren't even a little worried?"

"Yeah I am.  But I, we have time, you are incapacitated and can't do anything can you?"

I sighed.  "No I can try to tell someone else and then I can try another and another until Nox comes.  What do we need to talk about?"

Adrian laughed, "Shouldn't you be asking what don't we have to talk about.  Why don't you tell me how you found me."

"I expect you already know that answer."

Adrian nodded, "I can feel pack radiating from you, but it doesn't touch your skin.  You're afraid of it."

"I've never had someone else to worry about before.  It's all very confusing."

"And yet you did it because Nox asked you?"

I nodded again.  I really didn't have anything to add and Adrian seemed to understand that.  "Would you jump off a bridge if Nox asked you too?"

"Yes.  Because I know he'd catch me."

"You have blind trust in him?"  Adrian's smile told me he knew the answer and was happy about it.  "But you are afraid of the gifts he's given you.  To never feel alone again.  To always no matter where you go - always have family.  Nox has very little blood that loves him.  But you know as well as I do that his family is large.  And it will continue to grow because Nox's heart is boundless.  Every kid with out a parent breaks his a little more.  Every beaten mother and child, or father and son make him feel his own pain.  An empath?  But only with the horrible things because he's been through it."

"He's so much."  I said.  I didn't know how else to explain it.

"He just is, Alex."  Adrian chuckled.  "I remember the first day I met the boy.  He'd come to a party with his friends.  Not the good friends, not pack, not Mia and her blond.  The friends who lead him down a path of debauchery and pain.  But it lead him to me and I'm grateful I got to know the boy who has now become the man you love.  I should have known then the power he had at such a young age was raw and shapeable just like his mind.  And he'd been told by so many he was worthless he truly believes it."

"Who tells a child they are worthless." I said dumbfounded shaking my head.  I still couldn't believe someone would make Nox truly believe he was.

Adrian smiled.  "The Venatori did - everyday of his life.  And why?"  He asked me and I shrugged.  I didn't know why.  "Because they knew he was special.  He was different.  He was more than they could handle.  So what better way to handle a child who could rule them all but to tell him he's worthless, he's nothing, he's less than nothing?"

"You're telling me they knew he'd become whatever he is."

"Now I know Sage gave you information.  You've seen what they had on him.  The genetics, the blood work, his magical abilities are off the scale."

"And what about Garrett Spencer, did he know.  Was he part of it, a man who would abuse him?"

Adrian sighed, "I don't know.  But I'm sure then man connected to a demon knew more than the rest.  The demon tormented him, and feed on him.  And the man gained prestige from him.  I know you are angry at Nox for saving the man's life."

"I don't understand why he didn't just let him die."

"Because Nox is who Nox is.  Nox saw a man when the demon fled his body.  He didn't see his tormentor, he saw someone helpless and whom he could save.  If you felt you were a monster your whole life, and you put down every monster you ever came across.  Wouldn't you be a hypocrite for not ending your own life? Nox firmly believes in second chances.  Not because he's done anything wrong, but because of his potential to do wrong.  If he doesn't give others a second chance, why should we give him one?"

"But he's not a monster."  I growled.

"You and I both know that.  But the Venatori told Nox otherwise.  His dreams, his mother, everyone told him he was a monster.  He's not worthy of living.  He's going to do something horrible and he watches everything he does, he controls every aspect of his life down to the minute and he spirals out of mental control on the inside because he is so controlling on the outside.  You have made his life 1000 times better than it was, Alex.  He is not easy to love.  But you do love him."

"I do.  I don't know if I'll ever get used to this."

"Used to what, Nox's life?"

I nodded but said nothing more.

Adrian laughed, "Alex, because your love is my King, you are free to come talk to me.  I know you think that my sex therapy for Nox was a ploy but it helped him in ways Margo could not.  I council the pack as necessary free of charge.  It's one of the reasons Dom agreed to let me stay here in the city so many years ago.  Because the lone wolves usually came with a bad element.  In need of counseling and therapy.  I'm not saying you need therapy, but sometimes just telling someone else helps.  And telling someone who can also help and knows the things you live with is more help."

"I do have one question.  Pack, why do they sleep together?"

Adrian chuckled.  "Why do wolves?"  Adrian shrugged, "You are new, let the bond touch your skin and you'll understand.  Even if it's just Nox at first.  My first pack experience after I turned was in wolf form it was all on instinct.  For Nox and his kin - his brothers and children, they were born with the instinct for touch.  They don't understand it because they weren't part of the pack upon birth.  But my children grew up with it, new the feeling of pack.  And since you don't change your first experience with pack is as a human.  So your human mind processes it all differently.  Just let it be about pack with Nox.  Just him.  Not about sex, or pleasure, more about home and family.  Tell Nox it's about pack.  You are his mate, his true love, his soul mate.  Nox can show you the way as he did Sage.  But you should go now.  I will help Liam find Nox and tell him.  Wake!"

Adrian had shouted and my eyes blinked open in a strange new place, though I saw nothing but sound had returned.  Where the fuck was I?
