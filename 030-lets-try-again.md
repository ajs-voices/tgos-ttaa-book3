# Let's Try Again

The kids were all asleep in the other room.  Alex pulled me towards our bedroom.  Ant followed but he stopped at the door.  "I'll let you guys have some alone time."

Alex looked at Ant and frowned, there was tension between them  and it was because of me.  I sighed as I stepped inside.  "What happened between you two?"

Alex looked back at the closed door and shook his head, "Doesn't matter."

"It does matter, Alex."  I pulled him towards the bed and sat down.  "I can't have my best friend and my husband, my love, my everything fighting.  So tell me what happened?"

"Nox, I don't want to fight."

"This is not a fight."  I pulled Alex down on to my lap.  "Please Alex?"  I begged.

"He brought me here."  Alex said.  "And he didn't bring you."

"It's not his fault, he was following orders."  I said.

"You were an idiot.  I had to blame someone."

I sighed, "I'm sorry.  I will try not to do it again."

Alex growled, "Is that what you being so bossy was about?  All I am King you must obey."

"What?  I was just getting things done."  I said confused.

Alex laughed, "You didn't notice that everyone did what you said regardless of whether or not they agreed or not?"

"Did they disagree?"  I asked still confused.

"No."  Alex said surprised, "Every single one I could read was fully on board.  But that wasn't the point of my comment.  You needed to get stuff done why?"

I shrugged, "Because it needed to be done.  I fucked up.  I'm sorry.  I have a second chance to do it.  I won't screw up."

Alex pressed me to the bed.  "What if it's not a second chance though.  If Ryan is right then Nox, you are immortal.  You can't die.  Not ever.  Which means you'll watch me grow old and die."  He pressed a kiss to my lips.

The weight of Alex's body pressed me into the bed and I groaned as he shifted but my mind was lost in the fact that he thought he'd leave me - old age was a good enough reason, but I didn't want to think about it.  Alex chuckled and captured my lips with his _I think I can distract you._

And distract me he did.  His body and mine still clothed pressed together as close as possible.  I needed that contact, wished it was skin on skin.  The thought prompted hands under shirts, and soon it was a blur of clothes.  _Dreams make this so much easier._

I laughed as I bit into Alex's neck pushing a moan from low in his throat.  _I like this better._  I got to remember the taste of Alex in my mouth, the feel of his body against my skin.  The stretch of penetration.  I yearned for that feeling.  I needed it.  I needed Alex in so many ways.  Sex was only one aspect of the whole wanting Alex and need him.

Alex pressed hard against me pushing my hands above my head and biting my neck.  _You talk too much._

"I wasn't saying anything."  I chopped out through sharp breathes and moans.  

"Shush."  Alex commanded and I clamped my mouth shut and groaned as he ground into me.

There was a knock at the door.  "Go away Ant!"  Alex called out.

"How do you know it's Ant?"  I asked.

"Cause I can't sense anyone."

"Could be any other vampire."

Alex shook his head, "No, I feel other vampires differently.  With Ant it's like a constant hum but it's coming from you.  It's weird."

I sat up and sighed, "Did you feel that buzz when I was dead?"

Alex pressed me back to the bed but he cocked his head to think about it.  "I don't know.  I was full of angry thoughts and not really attuned to my senses."  Alex admitted.

Ant shouted through the door.  "I wouldn't bother you two if it wasn't important."

Alex groaned and climbed off of me pulling his shirt over his head and tossed mine at me.  "It's important."

"Alex?"  I said with my hands through my shirt but not quite ready to pull it over my head.  He turned and looked at me with a questioning look.  "This is why I scheduled the three hours to be with you."

His look softened.  "Not because you are an inconvenience, or an obligation but because no one respects my time unless it's scheduled. It's free for them to do what they want with it., and I really, really need time alone with you for just me and you it's not even the interrupted sex."  

Alex was walking back towards me and pressing his lips to mine.  "I'm sorry that made me angry. So three hours of undisturbed time or we can be spontaneous and be interrupted?"  Alex sighed and took my shirt and pulled it over my head to allow me to finish getting dressed.  "I'll try not to let the feeling disrupt us too much. But we do have an important calling now."

Alex walked over to the door while I still sat on the bed.  "What's so important?"

"The coven will speak with you both, but they said it had to be before four am.  Or tomorrow after midnight."

Alex held out his hand to me.  "We have what 30 minutes?"

Ant nodded.  "I can take you to them, they are waiting."

Alex frowned but nodded.  "I need to talk to them and so do you right, Nox?"

I nodded.  So much for alone time.
